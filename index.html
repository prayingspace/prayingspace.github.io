<center>5 “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</br>

  7 “And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. 9 Pray then like this:</br></br>

Our Father who art in heaven,</br>
Hallowed be thy name.</br>
10 Thy kingdom come,</br>
Thy will be done,</br>
    On earth as it is in heaven.</br>
11 Give us this day our daily bread;</br>
12 And forgive us our debts,</br>
    As we also have forgiven our debtors;</br>
13 And lead us not into temptation,</br>
    But deliver us from evil.</br></br>

14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; 15 but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</br></br>
